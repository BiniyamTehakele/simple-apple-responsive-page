        CPU must have some working space (fast access and close to CPU). This
        space is efficiently used to store intermediate values. Intermediate
        data are needed to be stored like Pointers, counters, return address,
        temp results, and partial products. Cannot save them in main memory
        because their access is time consuming. It is more efficient and faster
        to be stored inside processor. So the solution is designing multiple
        registers inside processor and connects them through a common bus.
